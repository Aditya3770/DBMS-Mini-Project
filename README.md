Quick Commerce Inventory & Driver Management SystemThis project is a complete management application for a quick commerce service, created for the PES University DBMS Mini Project. It features a multi-tabbed desktop GUI built with Python (Tkinter) that interacts with a robust MySQL database. The system effectively manages inventory, a fleet of drivers, and customer orders, all governed by secure and efficient database-side business logic.Team Details:ADITYA VENKATESH (PES1UG23AM024)ADARSH R MENON (PES1UG23AM016)FeaturesThe application is divided into four main tabs, each corresponding to a key user role:1. Customer AppPlace Orders: A simple interface for customers to select from available products and place an order.Real-Time Stock: The product list only shows items that are actually in stock, with quantities fetched live from the database.Cart Functionality: Add/remove items to a cart before placing the final order.Order Validation: The database (via a stored procedure) validates that there is sufficient stock before confirming the order.2. Warehouse ManagerManage Products: A CRUD (Create, Read, Update) interface for adding new products to the master product catalog.Manage Inventory: A dedicated panel to add new stock or update the quantity of existing products in the warehouse.3. Fleet ManagerManage Drivers: A CRUD interface for adding new drivers and updating their availability status (Available, On-Trip, Unavailable).Manage Fleet: A CRUD interface for adding new vehicles and updating their status (Available, In-Use, Maintenance).Assign Driver to Vehicle: An "Assign" utility that only shows available drivers and available vehicles, allowing the manager to pair them for a delivery.4. System AdministratorManage Customers: A simple CRUD interface for adding new customers to the system.Generate Sales Reports: A reporting tool to view all sales that occurred within a specific date range.Technologies UsedFrontend (GUI): Python 3, TkinterBackend Database: MySQLDatabase Connector: mysql-connector-pythonDatabase Logic: Advanced SQL (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Transactions)How to Run This ProjectFollow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.PrerequisitesMySQL Server & Workbench: You must have a MySQL server running (e.g., from the MySQL Workbench installer).Python 3: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.Step 1: Set Up the DatabaseOpen MySQL Workbench and connect to your local database server.Open the QuickCommerceDB_CompleteSetup.sql file provided in this repository.Execute the entire SQL script. This will:Create the QuickCommerceDB database.Create all required tables (e.g., PRODUCT, INVENTORY, DRIVER, ORDER, etc.).Insert the default "Main Warehouse" (ID 1), which is required by the app.Define all the necessary Stored Procedures, Triggers, and database fixes.Step 2: Set Up the Python EnvironmentOpen your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the project directory (where app.py is located).It is recommended to create a virtual environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required Python library:pip install mysql-connector-python
Step 3: Configure the ApplicationOpen the app.py file in a text editor.Find the db_config dictionary near the top of the file (around line 14).Change the user and password values to match your MySQL server's credentials (the ones you use to log in to MySQL Workbench).# IMPORTANT: Update this dictionary with your own MySQL Workbench credentials!
db_config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'your_username',    # e.g., 'root'
    'password': 'your_password',# Your MySQL password
    'database': 'QuickCommerceDB'
}
Step 4: Run the ApplicationWith your virtual environment activated and the db_config saved, run the app from your terminal:python app.py
The application window should now open. You can start by adding Products and Inventory in the "Warehouse" tab, and then placing an order in the "Customer App" tab.Database LogicThis project moves critical business logic into the database for security and integrity.Stored Procedures:PlaceNewOrder(...): This procedure handles the entire order process as a single, safe transaction. It checks stock, creates the order, updates inventory, and creates a payment record. If any step fails (e.g., out of stock), the entire operation is rolled back, preventing data corruption.AssignDriverToVehicle(...): Ensures that a driver and vehicle are updated together in a safe transaction.GenerateSalesReport(...): Joins 5 tables on the server to efficiently generate a report.Triggers:After_OrderStatusUpdate_Log: An audit trigger that automatically logs every order status change into the Order_History table.File Structure.
